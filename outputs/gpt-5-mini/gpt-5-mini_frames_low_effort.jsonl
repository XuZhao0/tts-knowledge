Austin comes to mind since it's home to the University of Texas, which is a Big 12 member, but I\u2019m not sure if there's a corresponding outgoing or former member in Austin.**Considering Texas and Austin**\n\nAlright, Texas is a founding member of the Big 12, and I need to check if Austin is home to a school that's an outgoing or former member of the Big 12 Conference. The University of Texas at Austin is relevant here, and I have to clarify that while they announced leaving, Texas officially left the Big 12 in 2024 to join the SEC. The current mayor of Austin is Kirk Watson, who attended the University of Texas\u2014so he has a connection to at least one US president, Lyndon B. Johnson, who also attended UT.**Exploring college connections**\n\nOkay, I remembered Lyndon B. Johnson attended Southwest Texas State Teachers College, which is now Texas State University. Now, regarding other presidents, there aren\u2019t many from the University of Texas. I\u2019m considering Colorado, where Denver is the capital, but the University of Colorado Boulder, a former Big 12 member, is located in Boulder. However, the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, is also relevant here, as it\u2019s home to the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, a founding member that left the Big 12 in 2011. The mayor of Lincoln in August 2024 is Leirion Gaylor Baird.**Investigating university connections**\n\nThe mayor of Lincoln, Leirion Gaylor Baird, was elected in 2019 and reelected in 2023. I\u2019m checking if she attended the same university as any US president, but it looks like no president attended the University of Nebraska. I considered other cities like Columbia, SC, which hosts the University of South Carolina (not Big 12) and Columbus, OH, where Ohio State is, but that\u2019s also not related to the Big 12. It seems Lincoln is a viable option since Nebraska was a former Big 12 member.**Identifying state capitals with universities**\n\nI\u2019m looking for a state capital that is home to a former Big 12 member, like Lincoln, but it seems the relevant universities don't align with US presidents. Austin is likely since the University of Texas is in the city and was a former full member of the Big 12. The mayor, Kirk Watson, attended UT, but no president has attended there. The requirement appears flexible regarding the university itself, as long as it matches one attended by a US president. Lincoln's mayor, Leirion Gaylor Baird, attended Nebraska and has a Master's from Harvard, but overall, it looks like options are limited.", "grading": "B", "model_name": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "reasoning_tokens": 2048, "completion_tokens": 2057}

To get this more precise, from February to August counts as an additional 6 months. So, counting from February 5 to August 24 gives me 6 months and 19 days.**Calculating months and release dates**\n\nI\u2019ve calculated that from February 62 CE to August 79 CE, there are 204 months, which is likely the answer expected for the time elapsed between that earthquake and the eruption. Now, the question goes on to ask about how many times Mount Vesuvius would have erupted between the 79 CE eruption and the release of the song \"Pompeii\" by Bastille on January 11, 2013.

I need to find the number of months between August 24, 79 CE, and February 11, 2013. That's 1934 years minus a few months.

So, I calculate total months as 1934 years times 12, minus 6, resulting in 23,202 months. But, I realize I need to adjust for the difference in days, since February 11 is earlier than August 24, meaning I'll subtract one additional month.**Calculating eruption frequency**\n\nI've calculated the total months as 23,201 using the formula. Now, I want to find out how many times Mount Vesuvius would have erupted by dividing that by 204 months (the time lapse between the earthquake and eruption).

The origins trace back to England, where lawn tennis was invented by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield in 1873. So, the country would be Great Britain or the United Kingdom. When it comes to players from Britain who have achieved a Grand Slam, Fred Perry is notable for completing a career Grand Slam by winning all four major tournaments. However, there seem to be no British women who have accomplished that.**Clarifying Grand Slam achievements**\n\nWhen we talk about players completing a Grand Slam, it could refer to singles, doubles, or mixed disciplines. Most likely, it pertains to achieving a career Grand Slam in their specific category. Looking at British players, I see Fred Perry is notable for his singles achievements. Virginia Wade won three major singles titles but didn't complete a career Grand Slam. While tennis originated in France as jeu de paume, lawn tennis itself started in England. It\u2019s fascinating how these places interconnect!**Exploring tennis origins and Grand Slam achievements**\n\nOriginal tennis, known as jeu de paume, originated in France during the 12th century. Many sources consider France the birthplace of tennis, while modern lawn tennis was invented in England. This leads me to wonder about players from France who completed a Grand Slam. In singles, no French player has won all four majors. I recall some notable Grand Slam achievements, like those of Don Budge, Rod Laver, and Steffi Graf, but none from Britain or France have completed a calendar Grand Slam.**Clarifying Grand Slam and tennis origins**\n\nI\u2019m considering the phrase \"complete a Grand Slam\" as winning a career Grand Slam in any discipline. It\u2019s true that Roy Emerson from Australia achieved this, but I'm focusing on French players now. Given that tennis first came from France (jeu de paume), it makes sense to look for players from there. Suzanne Lenglen won multiple majors but didn\u2019t complete all four, so it appears that no French players have accomplished it either. If we consider England as the birthplace of lawn tennis, I'd need to look into British players who completed a Grand Slam.**Calculating birth years of tennis players**\n\nSo far, it seems Fred Perry is the only British player to have completed a career Grand Slam in singles. I'm considering if I should include doubles or mixed achievements, potentially looking at players like the Doherty brothers, but they didn\u2019t play in Australia. The question asks for the sum of the birth years of players who both represented the country where tennis originated and completed a Grand Slam. I\u2019m concluding that Fred Perry's birth year, 1909, is likely the answer, so the total is 1909.", "grading": "B", "model_name": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "reasoning_tokens": 1024, "completion_tokens": 1035}

Francis Talbot was the 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, and his son, George, became the 6th Earl.

Denis Johnson is probably better known for \"Jesus' Son\".

The Pulitzer Prize wasn't awarded in 2012, and \"The Pale King\" by Wallace is significant here. Oh, and his \"Infinite Jest,\" which had those memorable opening lines.

WW1 ended in 1918, and Lloyd George was elected in the December 1918 general election, serving until 1945. Many New Zealand authors like Katherine Mansfield and Frank Sargeson are not the right ones since they died in earlier or later years. I should consider well-known Kiwi authors from that era.**Clarifying British PM timeline**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine who the first British PM elected after the end of WW1 is. I initially thought it could be Bonar Law, elected in 1922, but it seems the phrasing indicates it's about the first PM whose term started post-war. So that would actually be David Lloyd George, who was elected in December 1918 during the war. He died in 1945, and now I'm considering which Kiwi author also died that year, and maybe it's Elsie Locke.**Identifying the Kiwi author and PM**\n\nI realized that Eileen Duggan died in 1972, and Rewi Alley in 1987, while Katherine Mansfield died in 1923. I thought about Ramsay MacDonald, who became the first Labour PM in 1924, but he isn\u2019t the first PM elected after WW1. The first was David Lloyd George, who was elected in 1922 and died in 1945. Now, I\u2019m trying to pinpoint the New Zealand author who also died in 1945. Perhaps it's someone like Te Rangihiroa, but he actually died in 1951.**Identifying Kiwi author and PM**\n\nI'm trying to think of a famous New Zealand author who died in 1945. I remembered Allen Curnow, who passed away in 2001, and Katherine Mansfield, who died in 1923. I considered Andrew Bonar Law, who also died in 1923. But hold on\u2014could he be the first British PM elected after WW1? Bonar Law became PM in 1922, while Lloyd George was PM during the war. If we're considering who was the first new PM after the war, Bonar Law fits, matching his death year with Mansfield's.**Clarifying the answer**\n\nThe question is a bit ambiguous, but I see the clever angle: it's about the first British PM elected after the end of WW1. That would be Bonar Law, who became PM in 1922. However, the phrase \"to be elected\" makes me pause. Are they referring to someone elected in 1919 instead? But looking closely, I think the intended answer is actually Katherine Mansfield.

For 1932 in Los Angeles, there were approximately 1,276 athletes, with possibly 126 women. In 1936, Berlin had about 3,963 athletes, with around 328 women. \n\nFor the Winter Olympics, Chamonix, in 1924, had 257 athletes and around 13 women. The counts for 1932 and 1936 were lower.

For Russia, Mount Elbrus is the most prominent, and the second could be Klyuchevskaya Sopka, known for its prominence. I need to remember that Klyuchevskaya's first ascent was in 1788, done by Daniel Gauss. I\u2019ll be careful to keep track of the regions.**Seeking clarification on ascents**\n\nI think the user might want to know the differences in first ascents between Mount Saint Elias in 1897 and Klyuchevskaya Sopka, which was first climbed in 1788. But I\u2019m not entirely sure about the specifics of Klyuchevskaya\u2019s ascent. It seems like it may have been first climbed by locals before the documented ascent by Daniel Gauss. There's also the option of Mount Narodnaya, but I don\u2019t have all the facts straight. I might need to clarify what the user means by prominence list.", "grading": "C", "model_name": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "reasoning_tokens": 640, "completion_tokens": 700}
