The question is essentially asking how many hours, minutes, and seconds on Mars equal to 24 Earth hours. A Martian solar day, or sol, is approximately 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds in Earth time. This means 24 Earth hours correspond to less than one sol. I\u2019ll convert 24 hours into Martian time units to clarify.**Converting Earth hours to Martian time**\n\nI need to compute how many hours, minutes, and seconds in a Martian solar day correspond to 24 Earth hours. Mars divides a sol into 24 hours, but each of these hours is longer than Earth's. So, I'll express 24 Earth hours in Martian time. \n\nFirstly, a sol equals about 88775.244 seconds. This means one Mars hour is approximately 3698.9685 seconds, or 61 minutes and 38.9685 seconds. I find that 24 Earth hours is about 23.36 Mars hours when calculated with these values.**Formatting Martian time**\n\nNow, I need to convert the fractional hours into hours, minutes, and seconds. So, I break it down: 23 hours plus about 0.35786 hours means I get 23 hours and 21.4716 minutes. That gives 21 minutes and then 0.4716 of a minute translates to 28.296 seconds. After rounding, my final answer for the Martian solar day is 23 hours, 21 minutes, and 28.3 seconds.

I think I recall a figure around 3,600, but I need to verify this. The source mentions \u201cover 3,000 oases\u201d, so it could be 3,000 or possibly 2,800 as well. After checking the report, I believe the right number is 3,000 oases, so I\u2019ll go with that.

Vampire numbers have an even number of digits that can be factored into two fangs using all their digits. The sequence begins with 1260 and then 1395.
