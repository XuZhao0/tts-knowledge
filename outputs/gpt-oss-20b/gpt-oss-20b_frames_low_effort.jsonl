Here are your hints: The last letter of the re-arranged code is \"J\". The new airport was located in China.   With this information, what was the IATA code of this airport?", "answer": "LNJ", "response": "Answer: I don't know.", "thought": "We need to think: Houston has many airports: George Bush Intercontinental (IAH), Houston Hobby (HOU), Dallas Love (LTV?), actually Houston-Lubbock? Let's recall airports in Houston area: George Bush Intercontinental (IAH) has long runways ~11,000 ft. Hobby (HOU) runway ~7000? Hobby runway lengths: 7,000 ft? I think yes Hobby has 7,000 ft runway. So IATA code HOU. Rearrange to match another airport code ending with J in China. Rearrange HOU letters to form code ending J: possible 'HUO', 'OHU', etc. Need code ending J: 'OHJ'? 'HUJ'? 'JHU'? Chinese airport codes ending J: e.g., 'CHN' no. Let's think of Chinese airports codes ending J: 'XJX'? Actually codes like 'DJH'? Not sure. Maybe the code is 'JHU' (arrangement). Is there a Chinese airport with code JHU? I don't think so. Another possibility: the Houston airport might be 'LST'? Longest runway 7000? Houston's 'HOU' has 7,000. So rearrange HOU to 'HOJ'? Wait we need rearranged code ending J. So letters H, O, U rearranged to make a code ending J. That would require J letter, but we don't have J. So maybe the Houston airport is not HOU. Another Houston airport with 7000 ft runway: 'SLC' no. Let's check Houston 'KLR' (Lakewood?). Actually 'Lakewood' code 'LWD'? Not. The longest 7000 ft runway maybe at 'BWD' (Weslaco). But IATA code 'WES'?\n\nMaybe the airport is 'HOU' but the hint says rearrange those letters to match that of another airport. That implies same three letters but different order. So the other airport code uses same letters as the first but rearranged. So first code uses letters A,B,C. Rearranged to form another code D,E,F with same letters but order changed. So we need a Chinese airport code ending J that uses the same letters as a Houston airport with 7000 ft runway. So we need a Houston airport code that when rearranged gives a Chinese airport code ending J. Let's list Chinese airport IATA codes ending J: 'DJX' (Dengzhou?), 'HJU'? 'JHU'? 'JIA'? Actually 'JIA' is Jiamusi? IATA 'JIA' (Jiamusi). That ends with A. 'JIA' letters J,I,A. Need to match another Houston airport code letters J,I,A. But Houston airport codes: 'JIA' none. 'JIA' is Chinese.\n\nLet's think of Chinese airport ending J: 'XAJ'? 'YAJ'? 'BJY'? Wait Beijing is BJS, not J. 'ZJX'.\n\nMaybe the code is 'JHU' and the Houston airport 'HUJ'? There's no 'HUJ'.\n\nMaybe the Houston airport is 'SJT'? That's San Antonio. Not.\n\nMaybe the Houston airport is 'KLR'? No.\n\nLet's research mentally: Houston has 'Galveston' code 'GLV' (Galveston). 'GLV' runway 7,000? maybe. Rearrange GLV to 'GSV'? Not J.\n\nAnother Houston airport: 'TEX'?\n\nWait maybe the longest runway 7000 at 'HOU' 7,000. So code HOU. Rearrange to 'HUO', 'OHU', 'OHH'? None end J. So maybe not.\n\nCould be 'LAW'?\n\nMaybe the other airport code is 'JHO' (Shenzhen? no). 'JHO' is Jinhua? Jinhua airport code 'JIA'? Actually Jinhua is 'JIA'.\n\nLet's search memory: Chinese airports ending J: 'JIA' 'JIC' 'JIE' 'JIF' 'JIG' 'JIL' 'JIM' 'JIN' 'JIR' 'JIS' 'JIT' 'JIV' 'JIZ' 'JJA' 'OAJ' ?\n\nPerhaps the code is 'JHU' which is 'Jiujiang' airport? IATA JIU? Actually Jiujiang is 'JIA'? No.\n\nLet's think: Chinese airport 'JHU' maybe Juhu? There is 'JSH'? Hmm.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 'JHU' and the Houston airport 'HJU' but none.\n\nMaybe the Houston airport is 'SJT' San Antonio not.\n\nMaybe the Houston area includes 'LTV' (Love) in Dallas.\n\nMaybe the hint says \"The new airport was located in China.\" So the rearranged code corresponds to a Chinese airport.

Hmm.\n\nActually the Pulitzer Board revoked the award for \"The Old Man and the Sea\" in 1954? I think not. Wait: The Pulitzer Board did revoke the award for \"The Old Man and the Sea\" in 1954? I recall that Pulitzer Board in 1954 revoked the award for \"The Old Man and the Sea\"? Let's check memory: I think the Pulitzer Board did not revoke.

{"id": 462, "problem": "Since the turn of the 21st century, there has only been one year in which the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction has not been awarded. Among the finalists that year, one novel was published posthumously. The author of this posthumous publication is best known for a different novel published 15 years prior. The opening lines of this book later inspired a song by a band. The name of this band can be determined with the following calculation: find the age of the author on January 1 of the year the latter book was published, add four, and subtract the sum from the year this author was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. The name of this band was inspired by yet another book. What is the name of this book and its author?", "answer": "On the Road by Jack Kerouac", "response": "Answer:\n**Infinite\u202fJest** by **David\u202fFoster\u202fWallace**", "thought": "We need year not awarded Pulitzer Fiction since 2000s. That was 2008? Actually 2008 did award. 2011? 2009? I recall 2003? Wait: Pulitzer for Fiction not awarded in 2008? Actually 2008 award to James Ellroy? Not. I think 2008 had no award due to lack of submissions. Year 2008. Finalists included? 2008 finalists: John Banville, David Foster Wallace (posthumous) novel \"The Pale King\" published 2011. Wait Wallace died 2008; book published 2011 posthumously. 15 years prior to 2011 is 1996. He is best known for \"Infinite Jest\" 1996. Opening lines of \"Infinite Jest\" inspired a song by a band. The opening line: \"The first thing I notice, the sound of his voice, ...\"? Actually opening line of Infinite Jest: \"The first thing I notice when I open my eyes is the color of the sky.\" That inspired song by a band? Maybe \"Death Cab for Cutie\" no. Let's think: Opening lines inspired a song by a band. Which band wrote a song referencing that? Maybe \"The Strokes\"? Not.\n\nWe need calculate band name: find age of author on Jan 1 of the latter book year (2011). Wallace born 1942. On Jan1 2011 he would be 68 (since born 1942 December). Add four =72. Subtract sum from year he was Pulitzer finalist. He was finalist in 2008. 2008 -72 = 1936. That gives year 1936. The band name inspired by yet another book. So band name from a 1936 book? Wait calculation yields 1936. But that might be the year of the book that inspired band name. So find a book published 1936 that inspired a band name. For example, \"The Maltese Falcon\" 1938. Not. 1936 novel \"The Great Gatsby\" 1925. 1936 novel \"The Big Sleep\" 1939. 1936 novel \"The Red Badge of Courage\" 1895.\n\nMaybe miscalc: age 68 +4 =72. 2008-72 =1936. So year 1936. Which book published 1936 inspired a band name? The band: \"The Beatles\" named after \"Beatles\" no. 1936 book \"The Maltese Falcon\" no. 1936 novel \"The Little Foxes\" no.\n\nPerhaps I'm wrong year not awarded 2009? Let's check: 2009 had award to Margaret Atwood. 2010 had award. 2008 had award to James Ellroy? Actually 2008 award to James Ellroy? He won 2008? I think 2008 Pulitzer Fiction was awarded to James Ellroy for \"The Black Dahlia\". So 2008 had award. 2006 had award. 2004 had award. 2003 had award. 2002 had award. 2001 had award. 2000 had award. 2005 had award. 2011 had award. 2012 award. 2013 award. Wait year 2008? I'm mistaken.\n\nI recall 2008 had no award? Quick memory: 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction was not awarded due to lack of submissions. Yes that is correct. So 2008 finalists included David Foster Wallace. So calculation stands.\n\nNow which 1936 book inspired a band name? The band might be \"The Smiths\" named after a book? Not. 1936 novel \"The Good Old Days\"? 1936 novel \"The Big Sleep\" 1939.\n\nLet's search memory: 1936 book \"The Little Foxes\" 1931. 1936 novel \"The Golem\" 1910.\n\nMaybe the book 1936 is \"The Lost Weekend\" 1945.\n\nWhich 1936 book name is also a band? \"The Velvet Underground\" not.\n\nMaybe the calculation wrong: subtract sum from the year this author was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. That year could be 2008. Age 68+4=72. 2008-72=1936. So year 193. The book published 1936 that inspired a band name. That could be \"The Great Gatsby\"? no 1925. 1936 novel \"The Maltese Falcon\" 1938.\n\nMaybe the book is \"The Little Girl\" no.\n\nLet's think of famous band names derived from books: \"The Rolling Stones\" from a song. \"The Red Hot Chili Peppers\" from a comic. \"The Velvet Underground\" from a book? \"The Smiths\" from a book? \"The Clash\" from a novel? \"The Strokes\" from a book? \"The Strokes\" from a song. \"The Tragically Hip\" from a book.\n\nMaybe the band name is \"The 1975\" no.\n\nCould be \"The Long Lost\" no.\n\nPerhaps the 1936 book is \"The Little Foxes\" but band \"Little Foxes\" not.\n\nMaybe the answer expects book \"Infinite Jest\" by David Foster Wallace.

So maybe HMS Holland 1 launched 1898. In 1898 monarch died? Queen Victoria died 1901. So no. Could be earlier? HMS Holland 1 launched 1897? Let's search memory: Holland 1 launched 1897?

Count how many times Australia was above Korea. Then compute how many more times Australia was above South Korea than vice versa? The question: \"how many more times did Australia place above South Korea in the final medal rankings?\" That implies difference between counts of Australia above Korea and South Korea above Australia.

South Korea had 2 gold, 4 silver, 6 bronze = 12 total. So Australia above South Korea. That's 1.\n\n2004 Athens: Australia 16 gold, 25 silver, 17 bronze = 52 total. South Korea 17 gold, 7 silver, 13 bronze = 19 total. South Korea had more gold? Actually South Korea 17 gold, Australia 16 gold. So South Korea above Australia. So 0 for Australia above.\n\n2012 London: Australia 56 gold, 31 silver, 28 bronze? Actually Australia 56 gold, 31 silver, 28 bronze = 115 total. South Korea 12 gold, 10 silver, 21 bronze = 43 total. Australia above South Korea. So 1 more.\n\nThus Australia above South Korea 2 times (1992, 2012). South Korea above Australia 1 time (2004). Difference = 1 more time. So answer: 1.\n\nLet's double-check 2004 medal counts: South Korea 17 gold, 7 silver, 13 bronze. Australia 16 gold, 25 silver, 17 bronze. Gold counts dictate ranking, so South Korea above Australia.
